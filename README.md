<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Create virtual machines on Azure
- Step 2: Observe various network traffics

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<h3>Creating the Virtual Machines on Azure</h3>
<p>
In this lab, I will be observing various network traffic and experiment with the network security groups using Azure.

<p>
You first need to create a resource group on Azure for the virtual network and the virtual machines to live in.

</p>
<p>
I will create two virtual machines. First, I will create the Windows 10 virtual machine.

</p>
<p>
Then, I will create a Linux virtual machine. The important thing for these virtual machines is that the virtual network needs to be the same so they can talk to each other.  
</p>
</p>
<h3>Observing ICMP traffic</h3>
First we will be observing the ICMP traffic. I will try to ping the Linux virtual machine from the Windows virtual machine.

</p>
<p>
I am using a MacBook so I downloaded the Windows App to access the virtual machines.

<p>
  I have logged into the Windows virtual machine and Iâ€™ll be downloading Wireshark so we can track the different network traffics easily.
